## Why This Project?

PySQL was built to explore database internals and provide hands-on experience with:

- SQL parsing and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) construction
- Query execution engines and condition evaluation
- Schema management and type validation systems
- Data persistence and caching mechanisms
- Database constraint enforcement and conflict resolution

It serves as a realistic playground for understanding how production databases work internally, without the complexity of a full RDBMS.

## Quick Start

### Launch the Interactive Shell

**Easy way (recommended):**
```bash
python3 main.py
```

**Alternative:**
```bash
python3 cli/shell.py
```

### Basic Usage Example
```sql
-- Create a database and table
CREATE DATABASE my_app;
USE my_app;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR CHECK (LENGTH(email) > 5),
    age INT CHECK (age >= 0),
    created_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO users (username, email, age) 
VALUES 
    ('alice123', 'alice@example.com', 28),
    ('bob_dev', 'bob@example.com', 32),
    ('charlie', 'charlie@example.com', 25);

-- Query with aggregation
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young'
        ELSE 'Experienced'
    END as age_group,
    COUNT(*) as user_count,
    AVG(age) as avg_age
FROM users 
WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY age_group
ORDER BY avg_age DESC;
```

## Examples

### Using CTEs (Common Table Expressions)
```sql
WITH high_value_orders AS (
    SELECT customer_id, order_total, order_date
    FROM orders 
    WHERE order_total > 1000
),
customer_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(*) as order_count,
        AVG(order_total) as avg_order
    FROM high_value_orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT * FROM customer_stats
WHERE order_count > 5;
```

### Materialized Views and Refresh
```sql
-- Create materialized view for expensive query
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
SELECT 
    DATE(sale_date) as sale_day,
    COUNT(*) as total_sales,
    SUM(amount) as revenue,
    AVG(amount) as avg_sale
FROM sales 
WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE(sale_date);

-- Query the materialized view (fast)
SELECT * FROM sales_summary WHERE revenue > 10000;

-- Refresh when underlying data changes
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
```

### Set Operations
```sql
-- UNION: Combine results from two queries
SELECT name, email FROM customers
UNION
SELECT name, email FROM suppliers;

-- INTERSECT: Find common records
SELECT product_id FROM orders_2023
INTERSECT
SELECT product_id FROM orders_2024;

-- EXCEPT: Find records in first query but not in second
SELECT customer_id FROM all_customers
EXCEPT
SELECT customer_id FROM inactive_customers;
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Lexer**: Tokenizes SQL strings into meaningful symbols using regex patterns
- **Parser**: Builds Abstract Syntax Trees from tokens using recursive descent parsing
- **Executor**: Traverses AST and executes operations on in-memory data structures
- **Storage**: Uses MessagePack for efficient binary serialization to disk

### Persistence
- Databases stored as `.su` files in user home directory (`~/.pysql/`)
- Automatic caching of last used database
- Type-safe serialization/deserialization of all SQL types
- Supports concurrent reads (single writer)

### Performance Considerations
- In-memory operation for fast queries
- Optimized aggregate function implementations
- Efficient condition evaluation using Python's native operators
- Materialized views for expensive query caching

### Supported SQL Syntax
```sql
-- Data Definition Language (DDL)
CREATE DATABASE name;
CREATE TABLE name (columns...);
ALTER TABLE name ADD COLUMN/CONSTRAINT;
DROP TABLE/DATABASE/VIEW name;

-- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
INSERT INTO table VALUES (...) RETURNING *;
UPDATE table SET col=val WHERE condition RETURNING *;
DELETE FROM table WHERE condition RETURNING *;

-- Data Query Language (DQL)
SELECT columns FROM table
WHERE condition
GROUP BY columns
HAVING condition
ORDER BY columns
LIMIT n OFFSET m;

-- Advanced Features
WITH cte AS (SELECT ...) SELECT ... FROM cte;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW name AS SELECT ...;
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW name;
```
